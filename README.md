# COVID-19 Dashboard in Power BI

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard providing visual insights into the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes data preprocessing scripts, the dashboard itself, and a detailed analysis of three problem statements related to the data.

## Data Preprocessing

The `data_preprocessing` script  contains documentation outlining the steps taken to clean and prepare the COVID-19 data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and structuring it for effective visualization that was done through the Python file attached `DataPreprocessing.ipynb`.

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides interactive visualizations to track the spread and impact of the virus.

## Problem Statements

The analysis addresses the following problem statements:

1. **Trend Analysis** - How has the virus spread over time at both global and local scales?

Each problem statement is explored with corresponding visualizations and findings were documnented in the `report`.

## Viewing the Dashboard

To view the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Covid19_Power-BI.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Refresh the data if prompted to load the most recent data.
